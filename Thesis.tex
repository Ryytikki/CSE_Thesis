We describe the implementation and testing of the TREVR (Tree-based REVerse Ray-tracing) radiative transfer algorithm in the ChaNGa (Charm N-body Gravity solver) code. We calculated the optimal values for the source walk opening angle and ray trace walk refinement parameter of $\theta = 0.5$ and $\tau = 0.01$ respectively. We then studied the effects of the merging of sources on the accuracy of the calculated flux in absorbing regions, noting a systematic negative error and an angular dependence across all optical depths. We dubbed this the ``Complex Sources Problem" and provide suggestions to mitigate its effects.

First, I'd like to thank my supervisors, James Wadsley and Hugh Couchman for the constant advice, patience and occasional criticism to make sure I stayed on track. I'm sure the last two years have been an adventure for all of us and I look forward to any work we may end up collaborating on in the future. James also did an excellent job of enabling my breakfast cookie addiction during our weekly group meetings.

I appreciate the support from Jasper Grond, Joey Rucska and briefly Ben Keller, all of whom I had the pleasure of sharing an office with. Thank you for all the help settling in both at the university and in Canada in general. I've thoroughly enjoyed working with you all for the last few years and wish you all luck wherever the future may take you.

I'd also like to thank Tom Quinn at the University of Washington for the regular assistance with the code, particularly with solving a bug that had eluded me for months the day before my supervisory committee meeting. Without your patient and helpful advice I would have had a far more challenging time getting the code to where it is today.

Finally, I'd like to thank the numerous friends and family both near and far who have supported me through the last 2 years and beyond, particularly my partner Morgan, whose constant love and trust has helped me overcome every bump in the road to get to where I am. 

Also my cats, who are the best and nobody can convince me otherwise.

%The acknowledgements and the people to thank go here, don't forget to include your project advisor\ldots

I, Thomas Mudway, declare that this thesis titled, `THE EFFICIENT SIMULATION OF COMPLEX RADIATION SOURCES' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize} 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a research degree at this University.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.
